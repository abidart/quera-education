# QuEra Educational Materials

Welcome to QuEra's repo on quantum computing and neutral-atom technologies! Following this material you will be brought from 0 to 1 (or ground to Rydberg!) on concepts and programming schemes for doing experiments and simulations with our quantum tech and beyond. Stay tuned for updates, exercises, homework, and future challenges!

## Launch Options

There are two possible ways to interact with the examples here, either via qBraid, a cloud-based environment for accessing different quantum computing platforms, or locally on your own machine.

### Local Usage

To run this repo's content you'll first need to install the Python programming language on your system.



Then you'll need to ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab already installed on your computer. Jupyter Lab can be installed via `conda` or `pip` (see [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)) but you can also use notebook: (https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook).


Finally, you'll need to install the packages the tutorials rely on. We are doing our best to ensure requirement toml files exist inside each folder for ease of running.

Notice some of this content might require `Julia`, which can be installed and managed using [`juliaup`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).




### Usage on qBraid
